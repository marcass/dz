/**
 * Supports the concept of an observable service. Quite often it is required
 * that the checkpoints in the service lifecycle have to be tracked. The
 * checkpoints are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The moment the service is started;
 * <li> Service startup sequence completion, either successful or unsuccessful;
 * <li> The moment the service is stopped or has completed execution, either
 * successfully or unsuccessfully;
 * <li> Service shutdown sequence completion.
 * <ul>
 * Such notification is supported with the semaphores.
